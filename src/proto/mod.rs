/// Represents the internals of an HTTP/2 connection.
///
/// A transport consists of several layers (_transporters_) and is arranged from _top_
/// (near the application) to _bottom_ (near the network).  Each transporter implements a
/// Stream of frames received from the remote, and a ReadySink of frames sent to the
/// remote.
///
/// ## Transport Layers
///
/// ### `Settings`
///
/// - Receives remote settings frames and applies the settings downward through the
///   transport (via the ApplySettings trait) before responding with acknowledgements.
/// - Exposes ControlSettings up towards the application and transmits local settings to
///   the remote.
///
/// ### The stream transport
///
/// The states of all HTTP/2 connections are stored centrally in the `StreamStates` at the
/// bottom of the stream transport. Several modules above this access this state via the
/// `ControlStreams` API to drive changes to the stream state.  In each direction (send
/// from local to remote, and recv from remote to local), there is an Stream\*Open module
/// responsible for initializing new streams and ensuring that frames do not violate
/// stream state. Then, there are modules that operate on streams (for instance,
/// FlowControl).  Finally, a Stream\*Close module is responsible for acting on END_STREAM
/// frames to ensure that stream states are not closed before work is complete.
///
/// #### `StreamSendOpen`
///
/// - Initializes streams initiated by the local peer.
/// - Ensures that frames sent from the local peer are appropriate for the stream's state.
/// - Ensures that the remote's max stream concurrency is not violated.
///
/// #### `FlowControlSend`
///
/// - Tracks sent data frames against the remote stream and connection flow control
///   windows.
/// - Tracks remote settings updates to SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE.
/// - Exposes `ControlFlowSend` upwards.
///   - Tracks received window updates against the remote stream and connection flow
///     control windows so that upper layers may poll for updates.
///
/// #### `StreamSendClose`
///
/// - Updates the stream state for frames sent with END_STREAM.
///
/// #### `StreamRecvClose`
///
/// - Updates the stream state for frames received with END_STREAM.
///
/// #### `FlowControlRecv`
///
/// - Tracks received data frames against the local stream and connection flow control
///   windows.
/// - Tracks remote settings updates to SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE.
/// - Exposes `ControlFlowRecv` upwards.
///   - Sends window updates for the local stream and connection flow control windows as
///     instructed by upper layers.
///
/// #### `StreamRecvOpen`
///
/// - Initializes streams initiated by the remote peer.
/// - Ensures that frames received from the remote peer are appropriate for the stream's
///   state.
/// - Ensures that the local peer's max stream concurrency is not violated.
///   - Emits StreamRefused resets to the remote.
///
/// #### `StreamStates`
///
/// - Holds the state of all local & remote active streams.
/// - Holds the cause of all reset/closed streams.
/// - Exposes `ControlStreams` so that upper layers may share stream state.
///
/// ### `PingPong`
///
/// - Acknowleges PINGs from the remote.
/// - Exposes ControlPing that allows the application side to send ping requests to the
///   remote. Acknowledgements from the remoe are queued to be consumed by the
///   application.
///
/// ### FramedRead
///
/// - Decodes frames from bytes.
///
/// ### FramedWrite
///
/// - Encodes frames to bytes.
